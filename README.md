# Wikipedia Inline Context Expander
Wikipedia is great, but often assumes very heavy, domain exclusive knowledge. If you need to dig deeper, you can end up with hundreds of tabs all over your screen. 

Not anymore! With Wikipedia (Inline) Context Expander (WCE), you can keep your browsing experience in one tab!

## How can I use it?
For Chrome, simply head [here, to download it from the Chrome Web Store.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chat-tree/fjejdehlndcmcciepbpielnigfnaefpc) 

Once it's installed, head to your favourite wiki article. You can then either:
- Highlight a word, then right click and press `Expand inline from Wikipedia`.
- Right click a link, and then press `Expand inline from Wikipedia`.
Then, wait a few seconds, and your word will be replaced with the first line from the target wikipedia article (if it exists). 

## I want to contribute!

The project is hosted open source on [a github repository](http://github.com/acenturyandabit/wikipedia-context-expander).

There are a number of things that could be improved, including:
- Preserving the original text.
